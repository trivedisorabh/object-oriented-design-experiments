/**
 * Class to model relationships
 *
 * LOW level means - kind of no business logic, it has SRP most of the times,
 * here it is just managing the relationships
 *
 *
 * THIS IS A LOW LEVEL MODULE AS WE ARE PLAYING WITH THE DATA STRUCTURE ON HOW TO STORE
 * A RELATIONSHIP, WHICH INDEED CAN BE ABSTRACTED FROM THE USER.
 *
 * PROBLEM: We are exposing an internal storage implementation as public getter for everyone.
