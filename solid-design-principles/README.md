# SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

- A class should have a just a single reason to change single class should have one primary
 responsibility instead of taking lots and lots of responsibilities.
- If we take lots of responsibilities, then we end up with a GOD Object (which is an ANTI-PATTERN)
- Sometimes, we tend to add stuff to a class, which feels good to have. But, the object is doing more 
than what is required. The responsibility can be delegated to some other object.
- Which will make the class more test-able
- So, if we try to add functions like saveToAFile, loadFromAFile, loadFromAUrl. Then we are just introducing new concerns. 
Ideally when are class is deviating from "primary" responsibility. We should think about separation of concern.

# OCP (Open Close Principle)
- Idea is not jump into the code which you have already written. Foreg
    - Filtering of products, Idea is to filter.  
    - There could be endless combination of filter techniques depending on the product attributes. 
    - So, why not give this filtering logic to the caller. The filtering logic is independent of the criteria that user wants.	 
- It should be Open for extension, but close for modification. 
- So, modification of code that has already been written and tested is not great.
- It is ok to have separate logic which is closely defined to your model. But if the logic is influenced by lots of input. Then it is time to generalize the logic 
- Idea is not to jump in the code which is written
- It can be solved using specification principle
- You are free to extend or implement it but close to modify the existing code.
- So, keep this in mind when designing a class which could have a modify request in future. 
- Keep the variable business logic separate from fixed logic. In this way you don't need to change the code.

# LSP (Liskov Substitution Principle)
- Idea is to substitute sub class for a base class 
- So, if you have an API which takes a base class reference. It should be totally safe to pass sub class. (Without the things breaking)
- Can be achieved by Factory design pattern
    - Idea is to hide the construction logic of base and sub class.

# ISP (Interface Segregation Principle)
- Idea is to split interface to smaller interfaces
- You should not put something in your interface that is more than what client is expecting.
- Violation is forcing the API implementer to implement things that they don't support. User becomes puzzled if he/she is not sure about the api provided.

## YAGNI (You Ain't Going to Need It)
- This principle supports the idea behind ISP
- If your class does not need to support an extra feature. Then don't do it. Because you ain't gonna need it. ðŸ˜‰
- Use Decorator Pattern to delegate responsibility to implemented interfaces.

So, Instead of sticking everything into single Class. Make it minimum possible. So, that end user at some point does not face a dilemma of implementing work around of the things they cant support.
